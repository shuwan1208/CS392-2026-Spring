      The 'int' type in Java is for integers of some fixed precision.
      More precisely, each integer of the type int is represented as a sequence of bits
      of some fixed length. Please write a program that finds this length. Your program
      is expected return the correct answer instantly. Note that you can only use arithmetic
      operations here. In particular, NO BIT-WISE OPERATIONS ARE ALLOWED.
